MYSQL DB TEST SCRIPT

Spring is set-up to build the mySQL database, all you need to do is create the database. It initially builds anything new to the database, then updates even if you shut Spring down and start it back up.
## Budget Database Creation

CREATE Database moolah;
```

NOTES:

Ids are Long values autogenerated from within Spring.
Make sure Id's in message body null for POST requests and the correct userId for PUT requests.
